After setting up my website using mostly vim in a terminal that was connected to my VPS through an ssh connection. I knew that there had to be a more efficient way to manage my projects on remote machines with my own code editor than to use FileZilla and Atom. I did some research, and VSCode seemed like the perfect option, as it is an open source project with ample community support and plenty of extensions to personalize any developer's setup.

After downloading VSCode, I looked into setting myself up with extensions that would be useful and make the aestetics of my environment to my taste. The most important extension by far is the Remote - SSH one, which allows me to open and manage my projects directly on my VPS without having to use other less efficient methods. Another one of my favorite features of VSCode is the availability of a terminal in the editor, whcih makes it easy to quickly run commands and to see code at the same time as it is running in terminal. It certainly is a step up from just having three separate terminal windows open with separate ssh sessions like I have done in the past for my CS assignments.

This work is not the most glamorous or engaging, especially when you have a project that you really want to start on, but I feel that the amount of time it is already saving me even just to post to my own website is making it well worth my time to set up. The next thing I would like to do is learn how to use vim keybindings to effectively jump around and edit files without having to use the mouse often. This is a skill that can greatly increase my efficiency when writing and editing code.

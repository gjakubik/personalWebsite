This is the second project for my Operating Systems course. For this project I created a library in C that could send HTTP requests and recieve the responses. To make this application functional, it was necessary to learn how concurrency and more specifically multi-threading works. Along with this came the use of locks and condition variables to make sure that the messages are stored in the correct order(preservation of atomicity).

For this project in Programming Paradigms, my partner and I created a website that searches a database of global terrorism events. To make this work, we used Pandas to read in and handle a csv file containing the entirety of the database. This library was used by a REST API that we created using cherrypy, to which we added CORS support. The front end is made up of a classic web stack combination of HTML and JavaScript. We learned a significant amount of JavaScript, especially how to do networking in it, in order to complete this project as it wasn't a language that had been emphasized in our past classes. We focused on making a simple and easy to use interface to pull and display relevant info quickly.

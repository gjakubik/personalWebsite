I'm a software engineer specializing in modern web development with a focus on building intuitive, scalable applications. Currently, I work on complex financial technology platforms, where I've led the development of enterprise-level features from conception to deployment.

My technical interests span full-stack development, with particular expertise in React, TypeScript, and Next.js. I'm passionate about creating seamless user experiences and solving challenging technical problems, whether it's building AI-powered recipe management tools or engineering large-scale data visualizations.

When I'm not coding at work, I enjoy building side projects that solve real-world problems. Some recent projects include a ride tracking system for schools and a material usage forecasting tool for manufacturing. I'm always excited to explore new technologies and find elegant solutions to complex challenges.

I graduated from the University of Notre Dame with a BS in Computer Science, where I contributed to research in machine learning visualization that was presented at NeurIPS. Feel free to check out my work on GitHub or connect with me on LinkedIn to learn more about my projects and experiences.

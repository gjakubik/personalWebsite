I am a Junior Computer Science student at the University of Notre Dame. I am interested in learning more about web development and computer networks, and I made this site to begin gaining experience with both of those skillsets, along with having a space to share updates on my progress. I currently have links to my GitLab, which I mostly use for school assignments, my LinkedIn, and my GitHub, which I will be adding my own projects to as I work on them.

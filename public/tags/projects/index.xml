      <description>This is the first project for my Operating Systems course. For this project I created a library in C that defines several different scheduling policies for a CPU, along with a very simple custom shell that uses the scheduler. The policies I created were First In First Out (FIFO) and Round Robin. This project gave me a good idea of what low level process is in charge of something as important as scheduling every other process running on a computer.</description>

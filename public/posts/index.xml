			<description>Building this website with Hugo was surprisingly easy given the ability to use themes that take care of all of the styling for you, leaving only the content creation to the site administrator. One of the problems with Hugo is that it uses static website generation, which is fast but ultimately limiting because it does not enable dynamically serving content. The next thing I hope to do is script the steps of creating a new blog post for this website.</description>

One of the problems with Hugo is that it uses static website generation, which is fast but ultimately limiting because it does not enable dynamically serving content. The next thing I hope to do is script the steps of creating a new blog post for this website. I also want to learn some markdown so that I can make my content more interesting.</p>
<p>Eventually, I hope to move on to simply using Hugo as a tool to start my own website off of with the html generation, and then possibly use bootstrap to customize my site further than the Hugo theme allowed. I think that scripting the motion of files in my workflow is the next big step in mastering efficiently tackling interesting problems without getting caught up in time-consuming, menial tasks.</p>
